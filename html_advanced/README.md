# HTML: HyperText Markup Language
* The project have been done for an ALX for the course introduction to software engineering with the title **HTML ADVANCED**
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

* In this project I have clearly learnt how it defines and structure the content. Since every task has there own objective, clearly define the wireframe and how should we apply.
* HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.
